#### Bree.js  
The app uses Bree to schedule birthday notification emails. Bree is a job scheduler for Node.js that uses worker threads instead of the main thread.   

#### 
For parsing.  

#### Day.js  

One of the major challenges when building the app was to make calculations with date, so to determine whether a birthday was coming up within one day, a week, or a month. 
We decided to use Day.js, a JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times. Itâ€™s an alternative to Moment.js.
By default, Day.js parses and displays the date in local time. We opted to use the UTC plugin [because it makes it easier to calculate the birthday when someone lives in a different time zone???]. We also use the DayOfYear plugin, that converts the YYYY-MM-DD format into an integer between 1 to 365, making it easier to calculate.  
Another plugin used is duration [why?]
